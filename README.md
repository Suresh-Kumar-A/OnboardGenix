Employee Onboarding Automation Platform

## What the app is going to do
 Once hr added a new employee to the system, the system should handle all the onboarding process like creating a user account, emp id, getting all the docs(relieving letter, pay slips, id proof, photo), and third party verification authority(notifying them & tracking the process), email notification if possible.
